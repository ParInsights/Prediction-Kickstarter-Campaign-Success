# Prediction-Kickstarter-Campaign-Success
This project examines a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaigns dataset focusing on campaign success prediction. According to Kickstarter’s website “Kickstarter helps artists, musicians, filmmakers, designers, and other creators find the resources and support they need to make their ideas a reality. To date, tens of thousands of creative projects — big and small — have come to life with the support of the Kickstarter community.” The company provides opportunities for individuals to fund their creative projects using entirely crowd funding resources, meaning that the public is what sends these projects into production. Every project is brought to reality while friends, fans or complete strangers offer their funds in return for rewards or the finished product itself. The data was scraped from webrobots.io (https://webrobots.io/kickstarter-datasets/), combined, pre-processed, and created into a simple and easy to understand dataset that contains project data from 2014 to February 2019. The dataset is available on Kaggle.com: https://www.kaggle.com/yashkantharia/kickstarter-campaigns.
